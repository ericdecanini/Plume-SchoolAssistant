I'll be abandoning this project soon. It was my first but I'm not generally happy with the way I coded it, being very messy and all.

If anyone is willing to sort it out, I'll gladly offer the ownership of the app for free. Just send me an email at eddecanini@gmail.com.

All I'd ask is that you keep me properly credited as the original creator of the app, and if you write about the app online, that you include a link to my website https://www.ericdecanini.com/.

Much thanks!
